# Pandas: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level Pandas problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution Pandas code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for data science or technical interviews requiring intermediate Pandas skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium Pandas LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand advanced Pandas operations like grouping, merging, and window functions 🧠
- Apply best Pandas practices for optimized data manipulation 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with Pandas knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `replace_employee_id.md`): Include problem description, Pandas solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Replace Employee ID](./replace_employee_id.md)**: Replace employee IDs with unique identifiers.
- **[Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher](./number_of_unique_subjects_taught_by_each_teacher.md)**: Count unique subjects per teacher.
- **[Group Sold Products By The Date](./group_sold_products_by_the_date.md)**: Group sold products by date.
- **[Daily Leads and Partners](./daily_leads_and_partners.md)**: Count unique leads and partners per day and make.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `replace_employee_id.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, Pandas code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with Pandas installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, LeetCode’s Pandas editor). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the Pandas logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

```

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in Python using Pandas, compatible with LeetCode’s Pandas environment.
- Code follows PEP 8 standards and Pandas best practices (e.g., vectorized operations, clear column names).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Pandas code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time/space complexity, Pandas efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
