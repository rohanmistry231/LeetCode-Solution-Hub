# Pandas LeetCode Solutions 📊

## Overview
This folder contains Pandas solutions for LeetCode problems related to AI/ML and data manipulation tasks. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, optimized Pandas code, detailed reasoning, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews with a focus on data analysis skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master LeetCode data manipulation problems with efficient Pandas code ✨
- Understand data processing approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply Pandas best practices for optimal performance 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured data analysis knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `data_filtering.md`): Include problem description, Pandas code, reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. No subfolders for DSA topics or difficulty levels, as problems are organized by problem type.

## Contents
- **Problem Types**:
  - Data Manipulation: Problems like filtering, grouping, and merging datasets.
  - Data Aggregation: Problems involving groupby, aggregation functions, etc.
  - Data Cleaning: Problems like handling missing values, deduplication, etc.
  - Feature Engineering: Problems simulating real-world data preprocessing tasks.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `data_filtering.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, Pandas code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with Pandas (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, LeetCode Python editor). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand data processing techniques and optimization. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Example Structure

## Coding Standards
- All Pandas solutions follow best practices for data manipulation and performance.
- Code is written in **Python 3.x** with **Pandas 1.5+**, ensuring compatibility with LeetCode’s environment.
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability, with pylint 10/10 standards.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Pandas code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (e.g., computational efficiency, memory usage)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
