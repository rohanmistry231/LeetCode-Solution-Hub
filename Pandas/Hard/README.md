# Pandas: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level Pandas problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution Pandas code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced data science or technical interviews requiring complex Pandas skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master hard Pandas LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand advanced Pandas techniques like complex merges, window functions, and custom aggregations 🧠
- Apply best Pandas practices for optimized data manipulation 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced Pandas knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `sales_analysis.md`): Include problem description, Pandas solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Sales Analysis](./sales_analysis.md)**: Analyze sales data to find top products by year.
- **[Median of Employee Salary](./median_of_employee_salary.md)**: Compute median salary per department.
- **[Market Analysis I](./market_analysis_i.md)**: Calculate buyer activity metrics across years.
- **[Product Sales Analysis](./product_sales_analysis.md)**: Aggregate sales data with complex conditions.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `sales_analysis.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, Pandas code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with Pandas installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, LeetCode’s Pandas editor). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the Pandas logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in Python using Pandas, compatible with LeetCode’s Pandas environment.
- Code follows PEP 8 standards and Pandas best practices (e.g., vectorized operations, clear column names).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Pandas code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time/space complexity, Pandas efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
