# Pandas: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level Pandas problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution Pandas code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for data science or technical interviews requiring Pandas skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy Pandas LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand fundamental Pandas operations like filtering, grouping, and joins 🧠
- Apply best Pandas practices for optimized data manipulation 💡
- Build a foundation for technical interviews with Pandas knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `big_countries.md`): Include problem description, Pandas solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Big Countries](./big_countries.md)**: Filter countries based on area or population.
- **[Invalid Tweets](./invalid_tweets.md)**: Identify tweets exceeding character limit.
- **[Calculate Special Bonus](./calculate_special_bonus.md)**: Assign bonuses based on employee conditions.
- **[Recyclable and Low Fat Products](./recyclable_and_low_fat_products.md)**: Filter products with specific attributes.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `big_countries.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, Pandas code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with Pandas installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, LeetCode’s Pandas editor). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the Pandas logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in Python using Pandas, compatible with LeetCode’s Pandas environment.
- Code follows PEP 8 standards and Pandas best practices (e.g., vectorized operations, clear column names).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Pandas code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time/space complexity, Pandas efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
