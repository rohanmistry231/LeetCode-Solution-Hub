# Java LeetCode Solutions ☕

## Overview
This folder contains Java solutions for LeetCode problems, organized by Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics and difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, clean and efficient Java code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master LeetCode problems with robust Java code ✨
- Understand problem-solving through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply Java best practices for clean, maintainable code 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured DSA knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **DSA Topic Folders** (e.g., `Arrays/`, `Dynamic_Programming/`): Contain subfolders for difficulty levels (`Easy/`, `Medium/`, `Hard/`).
- **Difficulty Folders** (e.g., `Easy/`, `Medium/`, `Hard/`): Contain `.md` files for individual LeetCode problems.
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `two_sum.md`): Include problem description, Java solution, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Arrays](./Arrays/)**: Problems like Two Sum (Easy), Merge Intervals (Medium), Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Hard), etc.
- **[Linked Lists](./Linked_Lists/)**: Problems like Reverse Linked List (Easy), Merge Two Sorted Lists (Medium), etc.
- **[Stacks & Queues](./Stacks_Queues/)**: Problems like Valid Parentheses (Easy), Min Stack (Medium), etc.
- **[Trees](./Trees/)**: Problems like Binary Tree Inorder Traversal (Easy), Lowest Common Ancestor (Medium), etc.
- **[Graphs](./Graphs/)**: Problems like Course Schedule (Medium), Number of Islands (Medium), etc.
- **[Dynamic Programming](./Dynamic_Programming/)**: Problems like Climbing Stairs (Easy), Longest Palindromic Substring (Medium), Knapsack (Hard), etc.
- **[Sorting & Searching](./Sorting_Searching/)**: Problems like Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium), Merge Sort (Medium), etc.
- **[Backtracking](./Backtracking/)**: Problems like N-Queens (Hard), Permutations (Medium), etc.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a DSA topic folder (e.g., `./Arrays/`). 📂
- Select a difficulty level (e.g., `./Arrays/Easy/`). 📌
- Open a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `two_sum.md`) for the problem statement, solution, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the Java code in an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- All Java solutions use **Java 8+** features for clarity and efficiency.
- Code follows **Google Java Style Guide** for consistency and readability.
- Solutions are optimized for performance, maintainability, and robustness.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution code (fully working, tested in a Java environment)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
