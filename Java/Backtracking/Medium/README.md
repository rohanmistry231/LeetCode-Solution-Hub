# Backtracking: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level backtracking-related problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium backtracking-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand advanced backtracking approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Strengthen your technical interview skills with backtracking knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `permutations.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Permutations](./permutations.md)**: Generate all possible permutations of an array.
- **[Subsets II](./subsets_ii.md)**: Generate all unique subsets of an array with duplicates.
- **[Combination Sum](./combination_sum.md)**: Find all unique combinations summing to a target.
- **[Permutations II](./permutations_ii.md)**: Generate all unique permutations of an array with duplicates.
- **[Word Search](./word_search.md)**: Find if a word exists in a 2D grid.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `permutations.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the backtracking approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
