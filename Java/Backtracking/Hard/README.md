# Backtracking: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level backtracking-related problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master complex backtracking-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand sophisticated backtracking approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced backtracking knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `n_queens.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[N-Queens](./n_queens.md)**: Solve the N-Queens puzzle by placing queens on an NxN chessboard.
- **[Sudoku Solver](./sudoku_solver.md)**: Solve a 9x9 Sudoku board.
- **[Regular Expression Matching](./regular_expression_matching.md)**: Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
- **[Word Search II](./word_search_ii.md)**: Find all words from a list in a 2D grid.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `n_queens.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the backtracking approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
