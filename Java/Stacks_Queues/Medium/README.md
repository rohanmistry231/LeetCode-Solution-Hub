# Stacks and Queues: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level stack and queue problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium stack and queue LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand advanced stack and queue algorithms through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with stack and queue knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `daily_temperatures.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Daily Temperatures](./daily_temperatures.md)**: Find the number of days until a warmer temperature.
- **[Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](./evaluate_reverse_polish_notation.md)**: Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
- **[Min Stack](./min_stack.md)**: Design a stack that supports retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
- **[Next Greater Element II](./next_greater_element_ii.md)**: Find the next greater element for each element in a circular array.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `daily_temperatures.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the stack/queue algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
