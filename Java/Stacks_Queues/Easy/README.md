# Stacks and Queues: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level stack and queue problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy stack and queue LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand fundamental stack and queue operations through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Build a foundation for technical interviews with stack and queue knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `valid_parentheses.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Valid Parentheses](./valid_parentheses.md)**: Check if a string of parentheses is valid.
- **[Implement Stack using Queues](./implement_stack_using_queues.md)**: Implement a stack using two queues.
- **[Implement Queue using Stacks](./implement_queue_using_stacks.md)**: Implement a queue using two stacks.
- **[Next Greater Element I](./next_greater_element_i.md)**: Find the next greater element for each element in an array.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `valid_parentheses.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the stack/queue algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are provided in the parent language folder’s specified language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
- Code adheres to language-specific best practices (e.g., pylint 10/10 for Python, Airbnb style for JavaScript, Google style for Java).
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
