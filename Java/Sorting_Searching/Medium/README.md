# Sorting and Searching: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level sorting and searching problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium sorting and searching LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand advanced sorting and searching algorithms through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with sorting and searching knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `search_in_rotated_sorted_array.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Search in Rotated Sorted Array](./search_in_rotated_sorted_array.md)**: Search for a target in a rotated sorted array.
- **[Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](./find_first_and_last_position.md)**: Find the starting and ending position of a target value.
- **[Kth Largest Element in an Array](./kth_largest_element.md)**: Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.
- **[Top K Frequent Elements](./top_k_frequent_elements.md)**: Return the k most frequent elements in an array.
- **[Sort Colors](./sort_colors.md)**: Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s in-place.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `search_in_rotated_sorted_array.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the sorting/searching algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
