# Dynamic Programming: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level dynamic programming (DP) problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium DP-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand advanced DP techniques through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with DP knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `longest_increasing_subsequence.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Longest Increasing Subsequence](./longest_increasing_subsequence.md)**: Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
- **[Unique Paths](./unique_paths.md)**: Count unique paths in a grid with obstacles.
- **[Coin Change](./coin_change.md)**: Find the fewest coins needed to make a target amount.
- **[Longest Common Subsequence](./longest_common_subsequence.md)**: Find the length of the longest common subsequence of two strings.
- **[House Robber II](./house_robber_ii.md)**: Maximize loot in a circular street without robbing adjacent houses.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `longest_increasing_subsequence.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the DP approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are provided in the parent language folder’s specified language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
- Code adheres to language-specific best practices (e.g., pylint 10/10 for Python, Airbnb style for JavaScript, Google style for Java).
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
