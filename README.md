# LeetCode Solutions Hub 📚💻

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive hub for LeetCode problem solutions, designed for Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students and professionals. It organizes solutions by programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics, with each solution in a dedicated Markdown file. Solutions include detailed reasoning, best practices, and pylint 10/10 code for optimal clarity and performance. 🚀

## Purpose
Our mission is to help you:
- Master LeetCode problems with clear, efficient solutions ✨
- Understand problem-solving approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Learn best coding practices for Python, JavaScript, and more 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured DSA knowledge 🎯

## Repository Structure
- **Root**: Contains this README and language-specific folders.
- **Language Folders** (e.g., `Python/`, `JavaScript/`): Each holds DSA topic subfolders.
- **DSA Topic Folders** (e.g., `Arrays/`, `Dynamic_Programming/`): Contain `.md` files for individual LeetCode problems.
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `two_sum.md`): Include problem description, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices.

## Contents
- **[Python](./Python/)**: Solutions in Python with pylint 10/10 code quality. 🐍
- **[JavaScript](./JavaScript/)**: Solutions in modern JavaScript (ES6+) with clean, efficient code. 📜
- **DSA Topics** (within each language folder):
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Sorting & Searching
  - Backtracking
  - And more...

## How to Use
- Navigate to a language folder (e.g., `./Python/`). 📂
- Select a DSA topic folder (e.g., `./Python/Arrays/`). 🗂️
- Open a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `two_sum.md`) for the problem statement, solution, and reasoning. 📝
- Study the code, test it in your IDE, and review explanations to deepen understanding. 🛠️
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
