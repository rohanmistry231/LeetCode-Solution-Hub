# LeetCode Solutions Hub 📚💻

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive hub for LeetCode problem solutions, designed for Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students and professionals. It organizes solutions by programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java) and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics, further categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard). Each solution is in a dedicated Markdown file with detailed reasoning, best practices, and pylint 10/10 code (for Python) or equivalent standards for optimal clarity and performance. 🚀

## Purpose
Our mission is to help you:
- Master LeetCode problems with clear, efficient solutions ✨
- Understand problem-solving approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Learn best coding practices for Python, JavaScript, Java, and more 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured DSA knowledge 🎯

## Repository Structure
- **Root**: Contains this README and language-specific folders.
- **Language Folders** (e.g., `Python/`, `JavaScript/`, `Java/`): Each holds DSA topic subfolders.
- **DSA Topic Folders** (e.g., `Arrays/`, `Dynamic_Programming/`): Contain subfolders for difficulty levels (`Easy/`, `Medium/`, `Hard/`).
- **Difficulty Folders** (e.g., `Easy/`, `Medium/`, `Hard/`): Contain `.md` files for individual LeetCode problems.
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `two_sum.md`): Include problem description, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices.

## Contents
- **[Python](./Python/)**: Solutions in Python with pylint 10/10 code quality. 🐍
- **[JavaScript](./JavaScript/)**: Solutions in modern JavaScript (ES6+) with clean, efficient code. 📜
- **[Java](./Java/)**: Solutions in Java 8+ with robust, maintainable code. ☕
- **DSA Topics** (within each language folder):
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Sorting & Searching
  - Backtracking
  - And more...
- **Difficulty Levels** (within each DSA topic):
  - Easy/
  - Medium/
  - Hard/

## How to Use
- Navigate to a language folder (e.g., `./Python/`). 📂
- Select a DSA topic folder (e.g., `./Python/Arrays/`). 🗂️
- Choose a difficulty level (e.g., `./Python/Arrays/Easy/`). 📌
- Open a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `two_sum.md`) for the problem statement, solution, and reasoning. 📝
- Study the code, test it in your IDE, and review explanations to deepen understanding. 🛠️
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
