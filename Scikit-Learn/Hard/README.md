# Scikit-Learn: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level Scikit-Learn problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution Scikit-Learn code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced machine learning or technical interviews requiring complex Scikit-Learn skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master hard Scikit-Learn LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand advanced Scikit-Learn techniques like complex ensemble methods, custom pipelines, and advanced feature engineering 🧠
- Apply best Scikit-Learn practices for optimized model building 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced Scikit-Learn knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `gradient_boosting_classifier.md`): Include problem description, Scikit-Learn solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Gradient Boosting Classifier](./gradient_boosting_classifier.md)**: Train a gradient boosting model for classification.
- **[Custom Pipeline with Voting](./custom_pipeline_with_voting.md)**: Build a pipeline with a voting classifier.
- **[Feature Engineering with PCA](./feature_engineering_with_pca.md)**: Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **[Cross-Validation with Nested Grid Search](./cross_validation_nested_grid_search.md)**: Perform nested cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `gradient_boosting_classifier.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, Scikit-Learn code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with Scikit-Learn installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the Scikit-Learn logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
