# Scikit-Learn LeetCode Solutions 📈

## Overview
This folder contains Scikit-Learn solutions for LeetCode problems related to AI/ML and machine learning tasks. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, optimized Scikit-Learn code, detailed reasoning, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews with a focus on machine learning algorithms and preprocessing. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master LeetCode machine learning problems with efficient Scikit-Learn code ✨
- Understand algorithmic and preprocessing approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply Scikit-Learn best practices for optimal performance 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured AI/ML knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `feature_scaling.md`): Include problem description, Scikit-Learn code, reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. No subfolders for DSA topics or difficulty levels, as problems are organized by problem type.

## Contents
- **Problem Types**:
  - Classification: Problems like logistic regression, decision trees, etc.
  - Regression: Problems involving linear regression, ridge regression, etc.
  - Clustering: Problems like K-means clustering, DBSCAN, etc.
  - Data Preprocessing: Problems involving feature scaling, encoding, etc.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `feature_scaling.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, Scikit-Learn code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with Scikit-Learn (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, LeetCode Python editor). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand algorithm design and optimization. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Example Structure
```
Scikit-Learn/
├── feature_scaling.md
├── kmeans_clustering.md

## Coding Standards
- All Scikit-Learn solutions follow best practices for machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
- Code is written in **Python 3.x** with **Scikit-Learn 1.2+**, ensuring compatibility with LeetCode’s environment.
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability, with pylint 10/10 standards.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Scikit-Learn code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (algorithm choice, preprocessing steps, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (e.g., accuracy, computational efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
