# Scikit-Learn: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level Scikit-Learn problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution Scikit-Learn code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for machine learning or technical interviews requiring intermediate Scikit-Learn skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium Scikit-Learn LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand advanced Scikit-Learn operations like ensemble methods, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection 🧠
- Apply best Scikit-Learn practices for optimized model building 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with Scikit-Learn knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `random_forest_classifier.md`): Include problem description, Scikit-Learn solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Random Forest Classifier](./random_forest_classifier.md)**: Train a random forest model for classification.
- **[Grid Search Tuning](./grid_search_tuning.md)**: Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- **[Feature Selection](./feature_selection.md)**: Select important features using SelectKBest.
- **[Pipeline Integration](./pipeline_integration.md)**: Build a pipeline with preprocessing and modeling steps.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `random_forest_classifier.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, Scikit-Learn code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with Scikit-Learn installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the Scikit-Learn logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
