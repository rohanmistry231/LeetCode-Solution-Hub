# Data Standardization

## Problem Statement
Write a Scikit-Learn program to standardize features using StandardScaler (zero mean, unit variance).

**Input**:
- `X`: 2D array of features (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`)

**Output**:
- Standardized features (mean=0, std=1 per feature)

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= len(X) <= 10^4`
- `X[i]` has 2 features
- `-10^5 <= X[i][j] <= 10^5`

## Solution
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

def data_standardization(X: list) -> np.ndarray:
    # Convert to numpy array
    X = np.array(X)
    
    # Standardize features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_standardized = scaler.fit_transform(X)
    
    return X_standardized
```

## Reasoning
- **Approach**: Convert input to NumPy array. Use `StandardScaler` to standardize features (subtract mean, divide by standard deviation). Return standardized array.
- **Why StandardScaler?**: Ensures features have zero mean and unit variance, improving performance for algorithms like SVM or KNN.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Single sample: Scaling is trivial (returns zeros).
  - Constant feature: Standard deviation is zero; `StandardScaler` handles by setting to zero.
  - Large values: Robust due to numerical stability in Scikit-Learn.
- **Optimizations**: `StandardScaler` uses vectorized operations for efficiency.

## Performance Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * f), where n is the number of samples and f is the number of features (2), for computing mean and standard deviation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * f) for input and output arrays.
- **Scikit-Learn Efficiency**: `StandardScaler` leverages NumPy for fast computation.

## Best Practices
- Use `StandardScaler` for standardization.
- Ensure `X` is 2D for Scikit-Learn compatibility.
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Manual Standardization**: Compute mean and std manually (O(n * f), more control).
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  def data_standardization(X: list) -> np.ndarray:
      X = np.array(X)
      mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)
      std = np.std(X, axis=0)
      std = np.where(std == 0, 1, std)  # Avoid division by zero
      X_standardized = (X - mean) / std
      return X_standardized
  ```
- **MinMaxScaler**: Use min-max scaling instead (O(n * f), different normalization).
  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
  import numpy as np
  def data_standardization(X: list) -> np.ndarray:
      X = np.array(X)
      scaler = MinMaxScaler()
      X_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X)
      return X_normalized
  ```
