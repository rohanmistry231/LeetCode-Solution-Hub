# Scikit-Learn: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level Scikit-Learn problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution Scikit-Learn code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for machine learning or technical interviews requiring Scikit-Learn skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy Scikit-Learn LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand fundamental Scikit-Learn operations like basic model training, data preprocessing, and evaluation 🧠
- Apply best Scikit-Learn practices for model building 💡
- Build a foundation for technical interviews with Scikit-Learn knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `basic_linear_regression.md`): Include problem description, Scikit-Learn solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Basic Linear Regression](./basic_linear_regression.md)**: Train a linear regression model.
- **[K-Nearest Neighbors](./k_nearest_neighbors.md)**: Implement a KNN classifier.
- **[Data Standardization](./data_standardization.md)**: Standardize features using StandardScaler.
- **[Train-Test Split](./train_test_split.md)**: Split data into training and testing sets.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `basic_linear_regression.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, Scikit-Learn code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with Scikit-Learn installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the Scikit-Learn logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
