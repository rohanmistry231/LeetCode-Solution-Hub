# Linked List: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level linked list problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium linked list LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand advanced linked list operations through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with linked list knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `add_two_numbers.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Add Two Numbers](./add_two_numbers.md)**: Add two numbers represented as linked lists.
- **[Remove Nth Node From End of List](./remove_nth_node.md)**: Remove the nth node from the end of a linked list.
- **[Swap Nodes in Pairs](./swap_nodes_in_pairs.md)**: Swap every two adjacent nodes in a linked list.
- **[Odd Even Linked List](./odd_even_linked_list.md)**: Group all odd-indexed nodes followed by even-indexed nodes.
- **[Intersection of Two Linked Lists](./intersection_of_linked_lists.md)**: Find the intersection point of two linked lists.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `add_two_numbers.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the linked list algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
