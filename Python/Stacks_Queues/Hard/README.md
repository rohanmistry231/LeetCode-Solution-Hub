# Stacks and Queues: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level stack and queue problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master complex stack and queue LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand sophisticated stack and queue algorithms through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced stack and queue knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `largest_rectangle_in_histogram.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Largest Rectangle in Histogram](./largest_rectangle_in_histogram.md)**: Find the largest rectangle area in a histogram.
- **[Basic Calculator II](./basic_calculator_ii.md)**: Evaluate a string expression with basic arithmetic operations.
- **[Sliding Window Maximum](./sliding_window_maximum.md)**: Find the maximum element in each sliding window of size k.
- **[Trapping Rain Water](./trapping_rain_water.md)**: Calculate the amount of water trapped between bars.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `largest_rectangle_in_histogram.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the stack/queue algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
