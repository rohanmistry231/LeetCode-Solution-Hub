# Largest Rectangle in Histogram

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar heights where each bar has a width of 1, find the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

**Example**:
- Input: `heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]`
- Output: `10`
- Explanation: The largest rectangle is formed by heights [5,6] with area 5 * 2 = 10.

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

### Python
```python
def largestRectangleArea(heights: list[int]) -> int:
    stack = []
    max_area = 0
    heights.append(0)  # Sentinel value
    
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        while stack and heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
            h = heights[stack.pop()]
            w = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, h * w)
        stack.append(i)
    
    heights.pop()  # Remove sentinel
    return max_area
```

## Reasoning
- **Approach**: Use a monotonic stack to maintain indices of increasing heights. For each bar, pop bars from the stack when a smaller height is encountered, calculating the rectangle area with the popped height and width (distance to current index or previous stack index). A sentinel value (0) ensures all bars are processed.
- **Why Monotonic Stack?**: Efficiently computes the largest rectangle by tracking the boundaries of each barâ€™s potential rectangle in one pass.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Single bar: Area is height * 1.
  - All same height: Area is height * length.
  - Empty heights: Handled by constraints (length >= 1).
- **Optimizations**: Use sentinel to simplify logic; single pass through heights.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of `heights`, as each index is pushed and popped at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the stack.

## Best Practices
- Use clear variable names (e.g., `stack`, `maxArea`).
- For Python, use type hints and list as stack.
- For JavaScript, use array as stack with `push`/`pop`.
- For Java, use `Deque` and follow Google Java Style Guide.
- Use sentinel value for cleaner code.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Brute Force**: For each bar, find left/right boundaries (O(n^2) time). Too slow.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Split at minimum height (O(n log n) average). More complex.
