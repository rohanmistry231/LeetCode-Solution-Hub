# Rotting Oranges

## Problem Statement
Given a `m x n` grid where each cell can be 0 (empty), 1 (fresh orange), or 2 (rotten orange), every minute, any fresh orange adjacent to a rotten orange (4-directionally) becomes rotten. Return the minimum number of minutes until no fresh oranges remain, or -1 if impossible.

**Example**:
- Input: `grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]`
- Output: `4`

**Constraints**:
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `grid[i][j]` is 0, 1, or 2.

## Solution

### Python
```python
from collections import deque

def orangesRotting(grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    queue = deque()
    fresh = 0
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 2:
                queue.append((r, c))
            elif grid[r][c] == 1:
                fresh += 1
    
    minutes = 0
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    while queue and fresh > 0:
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            r, c = queue.popleft()
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:
                    grid[nr][nc] = 2
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
                    fresh -= 1
        minutes += 1
    
    return minutes if fresh == 0 else -1
```

## Reasoning
- **Approach**: Use BFS to simulate the rotting process. Start with all rotten oranges in a queue and count fresh oranges. For each minute, process all current rotten oranges, spreading rot to adjacent fresh oranges. Increment minutes per level. Return -1 if fresh oranges remain.
- **Why BFS?**: Ensures minimum time by processing oranges level by level (minute by minute).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - No fresh oranges: Return 0.
  - Unreachable fresh oranges: Return -1.
- **Optimizations**: Track fresh oranges to avoid checking the entire grid; modify grid in-place.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), as each cell is enqueued/dequeued at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the queue in the worst case (all cells are rotten).

## Best Practices
- Use clear variable names (e.g., `fresh`, `queue`).
- For Python, use `deque` and type hints.
- For JavaScript, use array for queue operations.
- For Java, use `LinkedList` and follow Google Java Style Guide.
- Track fresh oranges to optimize termination.

## Alternative Approaches
- **DFS**: Not suitable, as it doesnâ€™t guarantee minimum time.
- **Simulation with Grid Copy**: Use a new grid to track changes (O(m * n) time, O(m * n) space). Less space-efficient.
