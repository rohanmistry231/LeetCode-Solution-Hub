# Course Schedule

## Problem Statement
There are `numCourses` courses labeled from 0 to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first before taking course `ai`. Return `true` if you can finish all courses, otherwise `false`.

**Example**:
- Input: `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: Take course 0, then course 1.

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- All pairs are unique.

## Solution

### Python
```python
def canFinish(numCourses: int, prerequisites: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
    graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
    for course, prereq in prerequisites:
        graph[course].append(prereq)
    
    visited = [0] * numCourses  # 0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited
    def dfs(course: int) -> bool:
        if visited[course] == 1:
            return False  # Cycle detected
        if visited[course] == 2:
            return True
        visited[course] = 1
        for prereq in graph[course]:
            if not dfs(prereq):
                return False
        visited[course] = 2
        return True
    
    for course in range(numCourses):
        if visited[course] == 0 and not dfs(course):
            return False
    return True
```

## Reasoning
- **Approach**: Build a directed graph using an adjacency list where each course points to its prerequisites. Use DFS to detect cycles, marking nodes as unvisited (0), visiting (1), or visited (2). A cycle indicates that courses cannot be completed.
- **Why DFS?**: Detects cycles in a directed graph, ensuring all courses can be taken without circular dependencies.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - No prerequisites: Return true.
  - Single course: Return true.
- **Optimizations**: Use a single visited array to track states; explore only unvisited nodes.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is `numCourses` and E is the number of prerequisites, as DFS visits each node and edge once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for the adjacency list and O(V) for the visited array and recursion stack.

## Best Practices
- Use clear variable names (e.g., `graph`, `visited`).
- For Python, use type hints and list comprehension.
- For JavaScript, use array methods for initialization.
- For Java, use `ArrayList` and follow Google Java Style Guide.
- Use state-based visited array for cycle detection.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Topological Sort (Kahnâ€™s Algorithm)**: Use BFS with in-degree counting (O(V + E) time, O(V + E) space). Similar performance.
- **Union-Find**: Not suitable due to directed graph nature.
