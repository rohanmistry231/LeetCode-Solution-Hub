# Graphs: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level graph-related problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium graph-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand advanced graph algorithms through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with graph knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `course_schedule.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Course Schedule](./course_schedule.md)**: Determine if all courses can be completed given prerequisites.
- **[Number of Islands II](./number_of_islands_ii.md)**: Count islands formed by adding land positions.
- **[Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](./pacific_atlantic_water_flow.md)**: Find cells where water can flow to both oceans.
- **[Clone Graph](./clone_graph.md)**: Create a deep copy of a connected undirected graph.
- **[Rotting Oranges](./rotting_oranges.md)**: Find the minimum time for all oranges to rot.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `course_schedule.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the graph algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
