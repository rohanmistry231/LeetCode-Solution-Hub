# Python LeetCode Solutions 🐍

## Overview
This folder contains Python solutions for LeetCode problems, organized by Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, pylint 10/10 code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master LeetCode problems with clean, efficient Python code ✨
- Understand problem-solving through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply Python best practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured DSA knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **DSA Topic Folders** (e.g., `Arrays/`, `Dynamic_Programming/`): Contain `.md` files for individual LeetCode problems.
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `two_sum.md`): Include problem description, Python solution, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Arrays](./Arrays/)**: Problems like Two Sum, Merge Intervals, etc.
- **[Linked Lists](./Linked_Lists/)**: Problems like Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists, etc.
- **[Stacks & Queues](./Stacks_Queues/)**: Problems like Valid Parentheses, Min Stack, etc.
- **[Trees](./Trees/)**: Problems like Binary Tree Inorder Traversal, Lowest Common Ancestor, etc.
- **[Graphs](./Graphs/)**: Problems like Course Schedule, Number of Islands, etc.
- **[Dynamic Programming](./Dynamic_Programming/)**: Problems like Longest Palindromic Substring, Knapsack, etc.
- **[Sorting & Searching](./Sorting_Searching/)**: Problems like Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Merge Sort, etc.
- **[Backtracking](./Backtracking/)**: Problems like N-Queens, Permutations, etc.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a DSA topic folder (e.g., `./Arrays/`). 📂
- Open a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `two_sum.md`) for the problem statement, solution, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the Python code in an IDE to verify functionality. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- All Python solutions adhere to **pylint 10/10** standards.
- Code is written in **Python 3.x**, following PEP 8 guidelines.
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Best practices and alternative approaches

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! To add or enhance solutions:
1. Fork the main repository. 🍴
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/python-solution`). 🌿
3. Add or edit `.md` files in the appropriate topic folder with clear solutions and reasoning. ✍️
4. Ensure Python code scores pylint 10/10 and includes comments for clarity. ✅
5. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of changes. 🚀
