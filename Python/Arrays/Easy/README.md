# Arrays: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level array-related problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy array-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand problem-solving approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews with array knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `two_sum.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Two Sum](./two_sum.md)**: Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.
- **[Contains Duplicate](./contains_duplicate.md)**: Check if any value appears at least twice in the array.
- **[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](./best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.md)**: Find the maximum profit from a single buy/sell transaction.
- **[Valid Anagram](./valid_anagram.md)**: Check if two strings are anagrams using array-based techniques.
- **[Majority Element](./majority_element.md)**: Find the element that appears more than n/2 times in the array.
- **[Move Zeroes](./move_zeroes.md)**: Move all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining relative order.
- **[Intersection of Two Arrays](./intersection_of_two_arrays.md)**: Find common elements between two arrays.
- **[Single Number](./single_number.md)**: Find the number that appears exactly once in an array.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `two_sum.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
