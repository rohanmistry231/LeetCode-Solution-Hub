# Trees: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level tree problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium tree LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand advanced tree traversal and manipulation techniques 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with tree knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `binary_tree_level_order_traversal.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](./binary_tree_level_order_traversal.md)**: Perform level-order traversal of a binary tree.
- **[Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](./construct_binary_tree_from_preorder_and_inorder_traversal.md)**: Build a binary tree from preorder and inorder traversals.
- **[Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](./lowest_common_ancestor_of_a_binary_tree.md)**: Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes.
- **[Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](./binary_tree_zigzag_level_order_traversal.md)**: Perform zigzag level-order traversal of a binary tree.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `binary_tree_level_order_traversal.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the tree algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
