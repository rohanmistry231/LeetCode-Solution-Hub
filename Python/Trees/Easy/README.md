# Trees: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level tree problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy tree LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand fundamental tree traversal and manipulation techniques 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Build a foundation for technical interviews with tree knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `binary_tree_inorder_traversal.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](./binary_tree_inorder_traversal.md)**: Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree.
- **[Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](./maximum_depth_of_binary_tree.md)**: Find the maximum depth of a binary tree.
- **[Symmetric Tree](./symmetric_tree.md)**: Check if a binary tree is symmetric.
- **[Same Tree](./same_tree.md)**: Determine if two binary trees are identical.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `binary_tree_inorder_traversal.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the tree algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
