# Backtracking: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level backtracking-related problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy backtracking-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand backtracking approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Build a foundation for technical interviews with backtracking knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `letter_combinations_phone_number.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](./letter_combinations_phone_number.md)**: Generate all possible letter combinations for a given phone number.
- **[Generate Parentheses](./generate_parentheses.md)**: Generate all valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses.
- **[Combinations](./combinations.md)**: Generate all possible k-combinations of n numbers.
- **[Subsets](./subsets.md)**: Generate all possible subsets of a given array.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `letter_combinations_phone_number.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the backtracking approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
