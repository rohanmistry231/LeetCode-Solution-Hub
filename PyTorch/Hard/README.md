# PyTorch: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level PyTorch problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution PyTorch code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced machine learning or technical interviews requiring complex PyTorch skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master hard PyTorch LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand advanced PyTorch techniques like custom models, complex RNNs, and transfer learning 🧠
- Apply best PyTorch practices for optimized model building 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced PyTorch knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `complex_rnn_prediction.md`): Include problem description, PyTorch solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Complex RNN Prediction](./complex_rnn_prediction.md)**: Predict time series with a stacked RNN model.
- **[Custom Model Architecture](./custom_model_architecture.md)**: Build a custom neural network with skip connections.
- **[Transfer Learning Classification](./transfer_learning_classification.md)**: Fine-tune a pre-trained model for image classification.
- **[Attention Mechanism for Sequences](./attention_mechanism_for_sequences.md)**: Implement an attention-based model for sequence data.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `complex_rnn_prediction.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, PyTorch code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with PyTorch installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the PyTorch logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
