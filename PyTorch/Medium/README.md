# PyTorch: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level PyTorch problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution PyTorch code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for machine learning or technical interviews requiring intermediate PyTorch skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium PyTorch LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand advanced PyTorch operations like multi-layer neural networks, custom loss functions, and data pipelines 🧠
- Apply best PyTorch practices for optimized model building 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with PyTorch knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `multi_layer_perceptron.md`): Include problem description, PyTorch solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Multi-Layer Perceptron](./multi_layer_perceptron.md)**: Build a multi-layer neural network for classification.
- **[Custom Loss Function](./custom_loss_function.md)**: Implement a custom loss function for a regression task.
- **[Image Data Augmentation](./image_data_augmentation.md)**: Apply data augmentation techniques to image data.
- **[Time Series Prediction](./time_series_prediction.md)**: Predict time series data using a simple RNN.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `multi_layer_perceptron.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, PyTorch code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with PyTorch installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the PyTorch logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in Python using PyTorch 1.x or 2.x, compatible with LeetCode’s environment.
- Code follows PEP 8 standards and PyTorch best practices (e.g., `torch.nn` for models, `torch.Tensor` for operations).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - PyTorch code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time/space complexity, PyTorch efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
