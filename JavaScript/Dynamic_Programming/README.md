# Dynamic Programming 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions related to the Dynamic Programming topic, categorized by difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master dynamic programming-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand problem-solving approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured dynamic programming knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Difficulty Folders** (`Easy/`, `Medium/`, `Hard/`): Contain `.md` files for individual LeetCode problems.
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `climbing_stairs.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Easy](./Easy/)**: Problems like Climbing Stairs, House Robber, etc.
- **[Medium](./Medium/)**: Problems like Longest Palindromic Substring, Coin Change, etc.
- **[Hard](./Hard/)**: Problems like Knapsack, Longest Valid Parentheses, etc.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a difficulty folder (e.g., `./Easy/`). 📂
- Open a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `climbing_stairs.md`) for the problem statement, solution, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are provided in the parent language folder’s specified language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
- Code adheres to language-specific best practices (e.g., pylint 10/10 for Python, Airbnb style for JavaScript, Google style for Java).
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Best practices and alternative approaches

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! To add or enhance solutions:
1. Fork the main repository. 🍴
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/dynamic-programming-solution`). 🌿
3. Add or edit `.md` files in the appropriate difficulty folder with clear solutions and reasoning. ✍️
4. Ensure code follows the parent language folder’s standards and includes comments for clarity. ✅
