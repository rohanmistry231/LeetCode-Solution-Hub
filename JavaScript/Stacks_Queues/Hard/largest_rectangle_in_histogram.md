# Largest Rectangle in Histogram

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar heights where each bar has a width of 1, find the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

**Example**:
- Input: `heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]`
- Output: `10`
- Explanation: The largest rectangle is formed by heights [5,6] with area 5 * 2 = 10.

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

### JavaScript
```javascript
function largestRectangleArea(heights) {
    const stack = [];
    let maxArea = 0;
    heights.push(0);  // Sentinel value
    
    for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
        while (stack.length && heights[i] < heights[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            const h = heights[stack.pop()];
            const w = stack.length === 0 ? i : i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, h * w);
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }
    
    heights.pop();  // Remove sentinel
    return maxArea;
}
```

## Reasoning
- **Approach**: Use a monotonic stack to maintain indices of increasing heights. For each bar, pop bars from the stack when a smaller height is encountered, calculating the rectangle area with the popped height and width (distance to current index or previous stack index). A sentinel value (0) ensures all bars are processed.
- **Why Monotonic Stack?**: Efficiently computes the largest rectangle by tracking the boundaries of each barâ€™s potential rectangle in one pass.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Single bar: Area is height * 1.
  - All same height: Area is height * length.
  - Empty heights: Handled by constraints (length >= 1).
- **Optimizations**: Use sentinel to simplify logic; single pass through heights.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of `heights`, as each index is pushed and popped at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the stack.

## Best Practices
- Use clear variable names (e.g., `stack`, `maxArea`).
- For Python, use type hints and list as stack.
- For JavaScript, use array as stack with `push`/`pop`.
- For Java, use `Deque` and follow Google Java Style Guide.
- Use sentinel value for cleaner code.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Brute Force**: For each bar, find left/right boundaries (O(n^2) time). Too slow.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Split at minimum height (O(n log n) average). More complex.
