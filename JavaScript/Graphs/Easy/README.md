# Graphs: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level graph-related problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy graph-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand fundamental graph algorithms through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Build a foundation for technical interviews with graph knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `flood_fill.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Flood Fill](./flood_fill.md)**: Change the color of a connected region in an image.
- **[Find if Path Exists in Graph](./find_if_path_exists.md)**: Check if a valid path exists between two nodes.
- **[Number of Islands](./number_of_islands.md)**: Count the number of distinct islands in a grid.
- **[Keys and Rooms](./keys_and_rooms.md)**: Determine if all rooms can be visited.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `flood_fill.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the graph algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
