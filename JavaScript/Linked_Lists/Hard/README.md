# Linked List: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level linked list problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master complex linked list LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand sophisticated linked list algorithms through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced linked list knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `merge_k_sorted_lists.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Merge k Sorted Lists](./merge_k_sorted_lists.md)**: Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.
- **[Reverse Nodes in k-Group](./reverse_nodes_in_k_group.md)**: Reverse every k nodes in a linked list.
- **[Copy List with Random Pointer](./copy_list_with_random_pointer.md)**: Create a deep copy of a linked list with random pointers.
- **[LRU Cache](./lru_cache.md)**: Design a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache using a linked list.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `merge_k_sorted_lists.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the linked list algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are provided in the parent language folder’s specified language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
- Code adheres to language-specific best practices (e.g., pylint 10/10 for Python, Airbnb style for JavaScript, Google style for Java).
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
