# Intersection of Two Linked Lists

## Problem Statement
Given the heads of two singly linked lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two lists have no intersection, return null. The lists may share a common tail.

**Example**:
- Input: `headA = [4,1,8,4,5], headB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], intersect at node with value 8`
- Output: `Reference to node with value 8`

**Constraints**:
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^6`
- There are no cycles in the lists.

## Solution

### JavaScript
```javascript
function ListNode(val, next) {
    this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
}

function getIntersectionNode(headA, headB) {
    if (!headA || !headB) return null;
    
    let a = headA, b = headB;
    while (a !== b) {
        a = a ? a.next : headB;
        b = b ? b.next : headA;
    }
    
    return a;
}
```

## Reasoning
- **Approach**: Use two pointers to traverse both lists. When a pointer reaches the end of its list, redirect it to the other listâ€™s head. If the lists intersect, the pointers will meet at the intersection node after equalizing the path lengths.
- **Why Two Pointers?**: Equalizes the length difference between lists, ensuring pointers meet at the intersection or null in one pass.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - No intersection: Pointers meet at null.
  - Lists of different lengths: Redirecting handles length disparity.
  - Empty lists: Return null.
- **Optimizations**: Single pass with O(1) space; no need to compute lengths.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `headA` and `headB`, as pointers traverse both lists once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only two pointers are used.

## Best Practices
- Use clear variable names (e.g., `a`, `b`).
- For Python, use type hints for clarity.
- For JavaScript, use ternary operators for concise checks.
- For Java, follow Google Java Style Guide.
- Handle null checks early.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Length Difference**: Compute lengths, align pointers, then traverse (O(n + m) time, O(1) space). Two passes, less elegant.
- **Hash Set**: Store nodes of one list, check for intersection (O(n + m) time, O(n) space). Less space-efficient.
