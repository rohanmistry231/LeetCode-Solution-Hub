# Trees: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level tree problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master complex tree LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand sophisticated tree algorithms and techniques 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced tree knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `serialize_and_deserialize_binary_tree.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](./serialize_and_deserialize_binary_tree.md)**: Serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
- **[Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](./binary_tree_maximum_path_sum.md)**: Find the maximum path sum in a binary tree.
- **[Recover Binary Search Tree](./recover_binary_search_tree.md)**: Recover a binary search tree with two swapped nodes.
- **[Path Sum III](./path_sum_iii.md)**: Find the number of paths that sum to a given target.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `serialize_and_deserialize_binary_tree.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the tree algorithm and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are provided in the parent language folder’s specified language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
- Code adheres to language-specific best practices (e.g., pylint 10/10 for Python, Airbnb style for JavaScript, Google style for Java).
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
