# Trees 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions related to the Trees topic, categorized by difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master tree-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand problem-solving approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured tree knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Difficulty Folders** (`Easy/`, `Medium/`, `Hard/`): Contain `.md` files for individual LeetCode problems.
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `binary_tree_inorder_traversal.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Easy](./Easy/)**: Problems like Binary Tree Inorder Traversal, Maximum Depth of Binary Tree, etc.
- **[Medium](./Medium/)**: Problems like Lowest Common Ancestor, Binary Tree Level Order Traversal, etc.
- **[Hard](./Hard/)**: Problems like Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum, Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree, etc.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a difficulty folder (e.g., `./Easy/`). 📂
- Open a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `binary_tree_inorder_traversal.md`) for the problem statement, solution, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
