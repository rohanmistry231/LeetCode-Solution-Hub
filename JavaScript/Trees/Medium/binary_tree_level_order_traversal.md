# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

**Example**:
- Input: `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
- Output: `[[3],[9,20],[15,7]]`

**Constraints**:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution

### JavaScript
```javascript
class Solution {
    levelOrder(root) {
        if (!root) return [];
        
        const result = [];
        const queue = [root];
        
        while (queue.length) {
            const levelSize = queue.length;
            const currentLevel = [];
            
            for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                const node = queue.shift();
                currentLevel.push(node.val);
                if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
                if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
            }
            
            result.push(currentLevel);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Reasoning
- **Approach**: Use a breadth-first search (BFS) with a queue to process nodes level by level. For each level, record the size of the queue, process that many nodes, and collect their values in a list. Add child nodes to the queue for the next level.
- **Why BFS?**: Level-order traversal requires processing nodes level by level, which BFS naturally supports using a queue.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Empty tree: Return empty list.
  - Single node: Return [[node.val]].
  - Skewed tree: Each level has one node.
- **Optimizations**: Use queue size to process one level at a time; avoid unnecessary checks.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes, as each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (size of queue, O(n) in worst case for a complete binary tree).

## Best Practices
- Use clear variable names (e.g., `queue`, `currentLevel`).
- For Python, use `deque` and type hints.
- For JavaScript, use array as queue with `shift`/`push`.
- For Java, use `LinkedList` as `Queue` and follow Google Java Style Guide.
- Process levels efficiently with queue size.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Recursive DFS**: Use recursion with level tracking (O(n) time, O(h) space). More complex for level separation.
- **Iterative with Markers**: Use null markers in queue (O(n) time, O(w) space). Less clean than size-based approach.
