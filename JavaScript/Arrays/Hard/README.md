# Arrays: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level array-related problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master complex array-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand advanced problem-solving approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with sophisticated array knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `median_of_two_sorted_arrays.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Median of Two Sorted Arrays](./median_of_two_sorted_arrays.md)**: Find the median of two sorted arrays.
- **[Trapping Rain Water](./trapping_rain_water.md)**: Compute the amount of water trapped in an elevation map.
- **[First Missing Positive](./first_missing_positive.md)**: Find the smallest missing positive integer.
- **[Maximum Subarray Product](./maximum_subarray_product.md)**: Find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `median_of_two_sorted_arrays.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
