# Arrays: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level array-related problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution code, detailed reasoning, time/space complexity, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium array-based LeetCode problems with efficient solutions ✨
- Understand problem-solving approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply best coding practices for optimal code quality 💡
- Strengthen your technical interview skills with advanced array knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `merge_intervals.md`): Include problem description, solution code, reasoning, complexity analysis, and coding tips.

## Contents
- **[Merge Intervals](./merge_intervals.md)**: Merge overlapping intervals in an array of intervals.
- **[Group Anagrams](./group_anagrams.md)**: Group an array of strings into anagrams.
- **[Product of Array Except Self](./product_of_array_except_self.md)**: Compute the product of all elements except the current index.
- **[Rotate Array](./rotate_array.md)**: Rotate an array by k steps to the right.
- **[Spiral Matrix](./spiral_matrix.md)**: Traverse a matrix in spiral order.
- **[Set Matrix Zeroes](./set_matrix_zeroes.md)**: Set rows and columns to zero if an element is zero.
- **[Three Sum](./three_sum.md)**: Find all unique triplets summing to zero.
- **[Container With Most Water](./container_with_most_water.md)**: Find two lines that form a container with maximum water area.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `merge_intervals.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, solution code, and reasoning. 📝
- Copy and test the code in your preferred programming language’s IDE or environment. 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the approach and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
