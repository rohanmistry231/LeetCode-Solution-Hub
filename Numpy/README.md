# NumPy LeetCode Solutions 🔢

## Overview
This folder contains NumPy solutions for LeetCode problems related to AI/ML and numerical computation tasks. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, optimized NumPy code, detailed reasoning, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews with a focus on numerical data processing skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master LeetCode numerical problems with efficient NumPy code ✨
- Understand numerical computation approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply NumPy best practices for optimal performance 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured numerical analysis knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `matrix_operations.md`): Include problem description, NumPy code, reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. No subfolders for DSA topics or difficulty levels, as problems are organized by problem type.

## Contents
- **Problem Types**:
  - Matrix Operations: Problems like matrix multiplication, transposition, etc.
  - Array Manipulation: Problems involving reshaping, slicing, or broadcasting.
  - Statistical Computations: Problems like mean, median, or standard deviation calculations.
  - Linear Algebra: Problems involving dot products, eigenvalues, etc.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `matrix_operations.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, NumPy code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with NumPy (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, LeetCode Python editor). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand numerical techniques and optimization. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Example Structure

## Coding Standards
- All NumPy solutions follow best practices for numerical computations and performance.
- Code is written in **Python 3.x** with **NumPy 1.21+**, ensuring compatibility with LeetCode’s environment.
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability, with pylint 10/10 standards.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - NumPy code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (e.g., computational efficiency, memory usage)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
