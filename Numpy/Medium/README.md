# NumPy: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level NumPy problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution NumPy code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews requiring intermediate NumPy skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium NumPy LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand advanced NumPy operations like matrix operations, broadcasting, and statistical computations 🧠
- Apply best NumPy practices for optimized computation 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with NumPy knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `matrix_multiplication.md`): Include problem description, NumPy solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Matrix Multiplication](./matrix_multiplication.md)**: Perform matrix multiplication of two 2D arrays.
- **[Array Broadcasting](./array_broadcasting.md)**: Apply broadcasting for element-wise operations.
- **[Statistical Computations](./statistical_computations.md)**: Compute mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **[Array Sorting](./array_sorting.md)**: Sort a 2D array by a specific column.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `matrix_multiplication.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, NumPy code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with NumPy installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the NumPy logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Example Structure

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in Python using NumPy, compatible with LeetCode’s environment.
- Code follows PEP 8 standards and NumPy best practices (e.g., vectorized operations, efficient broadcasting).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - NumPy code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time/space complexity, NumPy efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
