# NumPy: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level NumPy problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution NumPy code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced technical interviews requiring complex NumPy skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master hard NumPy LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand advanced NumPy techniques like complex linear algebra, array manipulation, and optimization 🧠
- Apply best NumPy practices for high-performance computation 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced NumPy knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `eigenvalue_computation.md`): Include problem description, NumPy solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Eigenvalue Computation](./eigenvalue_computation.md)**: Compute eigenvalues of a square matrix.
- **[Convolution Operation](./convolution_operation.md)**: Perform 2D convolution on an array.
- **[Sparse Matrix Multiplication](./sparse_matrix_multiplication.md)**: Multiply sparse matrices efficiently.
- **[Fourier Transform](./fourier_transform.md)**: Apply Fast Fourier Transform to a signal.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `eigenvalue_computation.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, NumPy code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with NumPy installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the NumPy logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in Python using NumPy, compatible with LeetCode’s environment.
- Code follows PEP 8 standards and NumPy best practices (e.g., vectorized operations, efficient linear algebra).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - NumPy code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time/space complexity, NumPy efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
