# NumPy: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level NumPy problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution NumPy code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews requiring fundamental NumPy skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy NumPy LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand core NumPy operations like array manipulation, basic math, and indexing 🧠
- Apply best NumPy practices for optimized computation 💡
- Build a foundation for technical interviews with NumPy knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `array_sum.md`): Include problem description, NumPy solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Array Sum](./array_sum.md)**: Compute the sum of array elements.
- **[Array Reshape](./array_reshape.md)**: Reshape a 1D array into a 2D array.
- **[Element-Wise Multiplication](./element_wise_multiplication.md)**: Perform element-wise multiplication of two arrays.
- **[Array Indexing](./array_indexing.md)**: Extract elements using specific indices.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `array_sum.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, NumPy code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with NumPy installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the NumPy logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in Python using NumPy, compatible with LeetCode’s environment.
- Code follows PEP 8 standards and NumPy best practices (e.g., vectorized operations, efficient indexing).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - NumPy code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time/space complexity, NumPy efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
