# MySQL: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level MySQL problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution SQL query, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews requiring database skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy MySQL LeetCode problems with efficient queries ✨
- Understand fundamental SQL concepts like joins, aggregations, and filtering 🧠
- Apply best SQL practices for optimized query performance 💡
- Build a foundation for technical interviews with MySQL knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `combine_two_tables.md`): Include problem description, SQL solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Combine Two Tables](./combine_two_tables.md)**: Join two tables to report person details.
- **[Second Highest Salary](./second_highest_salary.md)**: Find the second highest salary from the Employee table.
- **[Duplicate Emails](./duplicate_emails.md)**: Identify duplicate email addresses in a table.
- **[Employees Earning More Than Their Managers](./employees_earning_more_than_their_managers.md)**: Find employees with higher salaries than their managers.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `combine_two_tables.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, SQL query, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the query in a MySQL environment (e.g., LeetCode’s SQL editor or local MySQL server). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the SQL logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Example Structure
```

```

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in standard MySQL syntax, compatible with LeetCode’s MySQL environment.
- Queries follow best practices (e.g., clear aliasing, readable formatting, efficient joins).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - SQL query (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time complexity, index usage)
  - Best practices and alternative queries
