# Department Top Three Salaries

## Problem Statement
Write a SQL query to find the top three unique salaries for each department in the `Employee` and `Department` tables.

**Table: Employee**
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key.
```

**Table: Department**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key.
```

**Example**:
- Input:
  - Employee: `[[1, "Joe", 85000, 1], [2, "Henry", 80000, 2], [3, "Sam", 60000, 2], [4, "Max", 90000, 1], [5, "Janet", 69000, 1], [6, "Randy", 85000, 1]]`
  - Department: `[[1, "IT"], [2, "Sales"]]`
- Output: `[[1, "IT", "Max", 90000], [1, "IT", "Joe", 85000], [1, "IT", "Randy", 85000], [2, "Sales", "Henry", 80000], [2, "Sales", "Sam", 60000]]`

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= Employee.id, Department.id <= 10^5`
- `0 <= Employee.salary <= 10^5`
- `1 <= Employee.departmentId <= 10^5`

## Solution
```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.departmentId = e.departmentId AND e2.salary > e.salary
) < 3
ORDER BY d.name, e.salary DESC;
```

## Reasoning
- **Approach**: Join `Employee` and `Department` tables to get department names. Use a correlated subquery to count how many distinct salaries in the same department are higher than the current employeeâ€™s salary. If fewer than 3, the salary is in the top three. Order by department and salary for clarity.
- **Why Correlated Subquery?**: Allows ranking salaries within each department without window functions, ensuring top three unique salaries.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Fewer than three salaries in a department: Return all salaries.
  - Duplicate salaries: Handled by `DISTINCT` in subquery.
  - No employees in a department: Handled by `JOIN` (no output).
- **Optimizations**: Subquery counts distinct salaries for accuracy; join on primary keys ensures efficiency.

## Performance Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m) in worst case, where n is the number of employees and m is the number of employees in the same department, due to correlated subquery.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), excluding output storage.
- **Index Usage**: Indexes on `Employee.departmentId`, `Employee.salary`, and `Department.id` optimize joins and subquery performance.

## Best Practices
- Use clear aliases (e.g., `e`, `d`) for readability.
- Specify join conditions with `ON`.
- Use `DISTINCT` in subquery to handle duplicate salaries.
- Format SQL consistently with proper indentation.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Window Function**: Use `DENSE_RANK()` for ranking (O(n log n), cleaner).
  ```sql
  SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
  FROM (
      SELECT name, salary, departmentId, 
             DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
      FROM Employee
  ) e
  JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
  WHERE e.rnk <= 3
  ORDER BY d.name, e.salary DESC;
  ```
- **Self-Join**: Compare salaries within departments (O(n^2), less efficient).
  ```sql
  SELECT d.name AS Department, e1.name AS Employee, e1.salary AS Salary
  FROM Employee e1
  JOIN Department d ON e1.departmentId = d.id
  WHERE (
      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.salary)
      FROM Employee e2
      WHERE e2.departmentId = e1.departmentId AND e2.salary > e1.salary
  ) < 3
  ORDER BY d.name, e1.salary DESC;
  ```
