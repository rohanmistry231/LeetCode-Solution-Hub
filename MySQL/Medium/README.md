# MySQL: Medium 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for medium-level MySQL problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution SQL query, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews requiring intermediate database skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master medium MySQL LeetCode problems with efficient queries ✨
- Understand advanced SQL concepts like complex joins, subqueries, and window functions 🧠
- Apply best SQL practices for optimized query performance 💡
- Strengthen technical interview skills with MySQL knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `nth_highest_salary.md`): Include problem description, SQL solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Nth Highest Salary](./nth_highest_salary.md)**: Find the nth highest salary from the Employee table.
- **[Rank Scores](./rank_scores.md)**: Rank scores in a table without gaps in ranking.
- **[Consecutive Numbers](./consecutive_numbers.md)**: Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
- **[Department Top Three Salaries](./department_top_three_salaries.md)**: Report the top three unique salaries for each department.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `nth_highest_salary.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, SQL query, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the query in a MySQL environment (e.g., LeetCode’s SQL editor or local MySQL server). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the SQL logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Example Structure
```
MySQL/Medium/
├── nth_highest_salary.md
├── rank_scores.md
├── consecutive_numbers.md
├── department_top_three_salaries.md
├── README.md
```

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in standard MySQL syntax, compatible with LeetCode’s MySQL environment.
- Queries follow best practices (e.g., clear aliasing, readable formatting, efficient joins and aggregations).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - SQL query (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time complexity, index usage)
  - Best practices and alternative queries
