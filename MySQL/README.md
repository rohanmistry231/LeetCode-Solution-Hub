# MySQL LeetCode Solutions 🗄️

## Overview
This folder contains MySQL solutions for LeetCode problems related to AI/ML and database tasks. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, optimized SQL query, detailed reasoning, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews with a focus on database skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master LeetCode database problems with efficient MySQL queries ✨
- Understand query design through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply MySQL best practices for optimal performance 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured database knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `second_highest_salary.md`): Include problem description, MySQL query, reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. No subfolders for DSA topics or difficulty levels, as problems are organized by problem type.

## Contents
- **Problem Types**:
  - SQL Queries: Problems like Second Highest Salary, Combine Two Tables, etc.
  - Data Aggregation: Problems involving GROUP BY, HAVING, etc.
  - Joins and Subqueries: Problems like Employees Earning More Than Managers, etc.
  - Database Design: Problems simulating real-world data manipulation tasks.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `second_highest_salary.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, MySQL query, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the query in a MySQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, LeetCode SQL editor). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand query optimization and approach. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Example Structure
```
MySQL/
├── second_highest_salary.md
├── combine_two_tables.md
├── employees_earning_more_than_managers.md
├── rank_scores.md
├── README.md
```

## Coding Standards
- All MySQL solutions follow best practices for query optimization and clarity.
- Queries are written for **MySQL 8.0+**, ensuring compatibility with LeetCode’s environment.
- Solutions are optimized for performance, readability, and maintainability.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - MySQL query (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (query approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (e.g., runtime, index usage)
  - Best practices and alternative query approaches
