# MySQL: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level MySQL problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution SQL query, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced technical interviews requiring complex database skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master hard MySQL LeetCode problems with efficient queries ✨
- Understand advanced SQL techniques like complex joins, window functions, and recursive queries 🧠
- Apply best SQL practices for optimized query performance 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced MySQL knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `median_employee_salary.md`): Include problem description, SQL solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Median Employee Salary](./median_employee_salary.md)**: Find the median salary for each company.
- **[Human Traffic of Stadium](./human_traffic_of_stadium.md)**: Identify consecutive days with high stadium traffic.
- **[Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends](./friend_requests_ii_who_has_the_most_friends.md)**: Find the person with the most friend requests.
- **[Shortest Distance in a Line](./shortest_distance_in_a_line.md)**: Find the shortest distance between points in a table.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `median_employee_salary.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, SQL query, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the query in a MySQL environment (e.g., LeetCode’s SQL editor or local MySQL server). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the SQL logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in standard MySQL syntax, compatible with LeetCode’s MySQL environment.
- Queries follow best practices (e.g., clear aliasing, readable formatting, efficient joins and aggregations).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - SQL query (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time complexity, index usage)
  - Best practices and alternative queries
