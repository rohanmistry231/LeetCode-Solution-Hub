# TensorFlow: Easy 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for easy-level TensorFlow problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution TensorFlow code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for machine learning or technical interviews requiring TensorFlow skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master easy TensorFlow LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand fundamental TensorFlow operations like tensor manipulation, basic neural networks, and data preprocessing 🧠
- Apply best TensorFlow practices for optimized model building 💡
- Build a foundation for technical interviews with TensorFlow knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `basic_tensor_operations.md`): Include problem description, TensorFlow solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Basic Tensor Operations](./basic_tensor_operations.md)**: Perform basic tensor manipulations like addition and multiplication.
- **[Simple Linear Regression](./simple_linear_regression.md)**: Build a linear regression model using TensorFlow.
- **[Binary Classification](./binary_classification.md)**: Implement a simple binary classifier with a neural network.
- **[Data Preprocessing](./data_preprocessing.md)**: Preprocess data for machine learning models.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `basic_tensor_operations.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, TensorFlow code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with TensorFlow installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the TensorFlow logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- Solutions are written in Python using TensorFlow, compatible with TensorFlow 2.x and LeetCode’s environment.
- Code follows PEP 8 standards and TensorFlow best practices (e.g., Keras API, eager execution).
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - TensorFlow code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (approach, edge cases, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (time/space complexity, TensorFlow efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
