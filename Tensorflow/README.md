# TensorFlow LeetCode Solutions 🤖

## Overview
This folder contains TensorFlow solutions for LeetCode problems related to AI/ML and machine learning tasks. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, optimized TensorFlow code, detailed reasoning, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for technical interviews with a focus on machine learning model implementation. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master LeetCode machine learning problems with efficient TensorFlow code ✨
- Understand model-building approaches through detailed explanations 🧠
- Apply TensorFlow best practices for optimal performance 💡
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured AI/ML knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `binary_classification.md`): Include problem description, TensorFlow code, reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. No subfolders for DSA topics or difficulty levels, as problems are organized by problem type.

## Contents
- **Problem Types**:
  - Classification: Problems like binary or multi-class classification.
  - Regression: Problems involving numerical prediction tasks.
  - Neural Networks: Problems requiring custom neural network architectures.
  - Data Preprocessing: Problems involving data preparation for ML models.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `binary_classification.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, TensorFlow code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with TensorFlow (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, LeetCode Python editor). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand model design and optimization. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or improvements (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗

## Coding Standards
- All TensorFlow solutions follow best practices for machine learning model development and performance.
- Code is written in **Python 3.x** with **TensorFlow 2.x**, ensuring compatibility with LeetCode’s environment.
- Solutions are optimized for readability, efficiency, and maintainability, with pylint 10/10 standards.
- Each `.md` file includes:
  - Problem statement
  - TensorFlow code (fully working, tested)
  - Detailed reasoning (model architecture, training approach, optimizations)
  - Performance analysis (e.g., accuracy, loss, computational efficiency)
  - Best practices and alternative approaches
