# TensorFlow: Hard 📚

## Overview
This folder contains LeetCode problem solutions for hard-level TensorFlow problems. Each problem is detailed in a dedicated Markdown file with a clear problem statement, solution TensorFlow code, detailed reasoning, performance analysis, and best practices. Designed for CSE students and professionals preparing for advanced machine learning or technical interviews requiring complex TensorFlow skills. 🚀

## Purpose
This folder aims to help you:
- Master hard TensorFlow LeetCode problems with efficient code ✨
- Understand advanced TensorFlow techniques like custom models, complex RNNs, and transfer learning 🧠
- Apply best TensorFlow practices for optimized model building 💡
- Excel in technical interviews with advanced TensorFlow knowledge 🎯

## Folder Structure
- **Problem Files** (e.g., `complex_rnn_prediction.md`): Include problem description, TensorFlow solution, reasoning, performance analysis, and optimization tips.

## Contents
- **[Complex RNN Prediction](./complex_rnn_prediction.md)**: Predict time series with a stacked RNN model.
- **[Custom Model Architecture](./custom_model_architecture.md)**: Build a custom neural network with skip connections.
- **[Transfer Learning Classification](./transfer_learning_classification.md)**: Fine-tune a pre-trained model for image classification.
- **[Attention Mechanism for Sequences](./attention_mechanism_for_sequences.md)**: Implement an attention-based model for sequence data.

## How to Use
- Navigate to a problem’s `.md` file (e.g., `complex_rnn_prediction.md`). 📂
- Review the problem statement, TensorFlow code, and reasoning. 📝
- Test the code in a Python environment with TensorFlow installed (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab). 🛠️
- Study the reasoning to understand the TensorFlow logic and optimize your learning. 🔍
- Contribute new solutions or optimizations (see [Contributing](#contributing)). 🤗
